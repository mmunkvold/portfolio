        <h1>And this is me...</h1>
        <p class="larger-txt">"If I was young again I would be a programmer", I told a fresh-out-of high school young boy the summer of 2020...</p>
        <p>
          And there you go - that was the start of doing something completely new* and something I really didn't think I would do as I didn't do it
          when I was STARTING my life way back in the 90's...
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm so thrilled that I did it anyway, and now two years later, I am soon to be living my childhood dream, doing programming and web
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          My first encounter with the "programming" world was when I bought my first computer, an Amstrad CPC464, where I could change the color on
          the text by writing some code following a manual...
        </p>
        <p>
          Now it sounds like I'm a computer nerd, with a room full of outdated hardware... I'm not. Really not. I can't even remember what happened to
          that Amstrad...
        </p>
        <p>
          *In the years that followed I took graphic design, but didn't use it for work purposes. Later on I took some marketing and webdesign, but
          didn't use that for work purposes either. Then my brother and I started a tour operator company in Thailand and we needed a website for
          that. Finally I could get something out of what I have previously learnt.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays I try doing some small stuff in my spare time to get more experience, and I'm doing some freelancing making websites and internet
          ads on the side.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my spare time I love to read, write, watch movies, go for a swim, do yoga and meditation, hug trees and cuddle up on the couch with my
          little buddy. And learn new stuff, I always want to learn new stuff.
        </p>
        <p>And the magpie, you ask? Oh, I just love those rascals!</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Get in touch</h2>
        <p>
          After finishing my studies at Noroff, I've been doing some freelance stuff together with working part time for a company based in Trondheim.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been working there since May last year. My role there is responsible for the design and layout of internal systems that we create for
          customers. We use Vue and Tailwindcss for this.
        </p>
        <p>As they sadly don't have enough work for me to work full time, I'm looking for other opportunities to further grow and learn more.</p>
        <p>If you want to know more about me and find out if I fit in with your company, check out this portfolio and my CV.</p>
        <p>
          Then you can send me an email or contact me on LinkedIn if you want to buy me a cup of boba tea, and if my trÃ¸nder-charm don't charm you,
          I'll pay for the tea...
