            <h2><i class="skill-icon fab fa-html5"></i>HTML</h2>
            <p class="bold">Everything starts with HTML..</p>
            <p>
              ..and so did my journey into coding and frontend development. I just LOVE HTML and building up a page from scratch. There is so much
              more to HTML than people think...
            </p>
            <p>I still have some left to learn, but I feel HTML and I are becoming very good buddies.</p>

            <h2><i class="skill-icon fab fa-css3"></i>CSS</h2>
            <p class="bold">And then came CSS..</p>
            <p>..and as if I weren't already in love with coding, I fell deeply in love when introduced to CSS.</p>
            <p>I still go my rounds with animating and trying to choose between grid and flexbox, but HTML, CSS and me make a good trio.</p>

              <h3>CSS Frameworks</h3>
              <p class="bold">SASS/SCSS, BOOTSTRAP, BULMA, TAILWIND</p>
              <p>
                When it comes to styling, I often prefer using vanilla css, but I've made some smaller projects using sass/scss, bootstrap, bulma,
                tailwind, CSS modules and styled components.
              </p>
              <p>My latest projects involves <strong>Tailwindcss</strong> (and Vue) and I'm really starting to love working with that.</p>
            </div>

            <h2><i class="skill-icon fab fa-js"></i>JAVASCRIPT</h2>
            <p class="bold">Enter the "bad guy"..</p>
            <p class="italic">A house with good foundation and a nice appearence is nothing without life to fill it.</p>
            <p>I still argue a bit with JS, so JS is where my focus lies going forward, as my wish is that JS and I could be besties for life.</p>

              <h3>JS Frameworks</h3>
              <p>
                Just started out using js frameworks and libraries. Still much to see and much to learn here. After changing hats, I usually prefer
                the one I'm currently working on.
              </p>
              <p class="bold">REACT</p>
              <p>
                I've made some school projects with React, and have a lot yet to learn there, but getting more and more secure in building with React.
              </p>
              <p class="bold">VUE3</p>
              <p>
                Started using Vue last spring, so a lot more to learn there also. Really enjoying working with Vue. My current projects involve
                <strong>Vue</strong> (and Tailwindcss).

            <p class="bold">CMS is CMS is CMS..</p>
            <p>
              ..or in this case plugin, plugin, plugin.. I have made a few sites and blogs in wp, and used woocommerce for making simple apis and used
              as "database" for blog posts, products etc.
            </p>
            <p>We go way back, but still only aquaintances as we see each other only now and then.</p>

            <p>I LOVE making designs, <small>I hate making designs</small>, I LOVE making designs...</p>
            <p>I feel design and me are on good terms, for most of the time we play well together, could well be better, but we do alright.</p>
